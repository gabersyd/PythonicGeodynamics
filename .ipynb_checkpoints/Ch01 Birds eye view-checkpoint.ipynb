    "The purpose of the book [Pythonic Geodynamics](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319556802) and of these Jupyter Notebooks is to introduce the reader to some fundamental techniques used to model the evolution of solid planets, such as is Earth, using computers of small as well as great power. I will treat these numerical methods from a very general standpoint, using examples of how to solve fundamental equations in physics and fluid-dynamics, and only finally showing the application to geodynamics. The intention is to leave to the reader the freedom to develop the geodynamic model that they desire, without sticking to a specific numerical approach or predetermined assumptions for geodynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "To teach these techniques I will employ *Python*, a free programming language that uniquely shares the property of being simple, powerful and widely used in science and engineering. During the development of Python many projects have grown together with it. For example *NumPy* has been developed to increase performance for all vectorial operations, the main tool necessary to solve numerical problems. *MatPlotLib* has been introduced to offer a visualization experience similar to the commercial package Matlab, but has now grown to being the standard for Python users. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the book I will teach to use *iPython* (interactive Python), a powerful front-end that allows to easily familiarizing with the language and testing it. Later in the book I will present more advanced and sophisticated implementations that can be run from a bash shell or from a comprehensive environments. While I write, the two largest projects aimed at developing a universal environment for Python are [Anaconda Spyder](https://www.continuum.io/) and [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/). Both are available and come with the numerical and visualization libraries on Linux, OS X and Windows platforms, allowing every user to skip the tedious procedure of installing a large number of libraries.\n",

    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "The genesis of Python goes back to the work of the dutch programmer Guido van Rossum who created the first implementation in December 1989, and released it for the first time in 1991. For this reason he has been informally nominated *Benevolent Dictator for Life* by the Python developers community. This simply means that in case of an unsolvable controversy he will take the definitive decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since then Python, together with other popular dynamic programming languages such as Perl and Ruby, has taken off becoming the standard in many sectors of software development. Definitive versions have been released on January 1994 (1.0) and on October 2000 (2.0). \n",
    "\n",
    "The development of Python faced a twist on December 2008 when a backwards-incompatible 3.0 version was released. Suddenly some Python software could run only on Python 2.x while others only on Python 3.x, which irritated many users. After 8 years from the first release of Python 3.x, however, the new software is almost exclusively developed for the new version of Python. In fact Python 2.x will continue to be supported only until 2020. After that Python 3.x will become the only supported version, therefore it is wise to write your software on Python 3.x only. It is important to emphasize that most incompatibilities between Python 2.x and 3.x are not related to the content of this book, but concern mostly I/O (input/output). Still some new features are essential in allowing Python programmers to use *threads* that are essential today with the large availability of heterogeneous parallel machines, therefore Python 3.x has to be the choice for the new developer. Most examples of this book run equally well on both platform, with some possible conflicts arising when exporting the results and data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways computer science is an art. When two different implementations exist for solving the same problem, computer scientists debate about which one is the \"best\" one, or the \"most elegant\", often related to subjective opinions. Languages are therefore preferred by computer scientist when for each problem there is clearly one and only one *best* way to implement its solution. Python often displays this property, however as T. Peters in *The Zen of Python* observed: \n",
    ">There should be one, and preferably only one obvious way to do it. \n",
    ">Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many books can introduce you to the Python Language. For the ones who did not have any experience at all with programming, **Think Python** from Allen B. Downey, O'Reilly, is a clear and simple guide. The book is presently freely available [here](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) where a PDF copy of the book can be downloaded, both for the 2.x and 3.x versions. More details, the complete manuals and tutorials are freely available on the [Python Website](http://python.org/), as well as many on other sources such as [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) and [Python Course](http://www.python-course.eu/). \n",
    "\n",
    "The rise of Python has triggered the development of a huge number of tools to expand its functionality. Its ability to integrate existing compiled software, C and C++ above all, but also Fortran, has allowed building hybrid projects where Python plays the role of glue between them. In the last years, in particular, [Cython](http://cython.org/) has become the principle way for creating compiled extension for Numerical Python. It is as well possible to integrate C and C++ code inside the Python programs, for example by using CPython.\n",

    "Generally scripts are not structured, but simply a list of instructions that operate on a dataset organized ad-hoc for the script. Programs are more autonomous, create own data structures, allocate memory, and in general take more control of the machine. As we will see more in detail in the next chapter using NumPy, Cython and analogue tools we take full control of the machine as with a standard programming language, therefore literally *programming* in Python.\n",

Python programs are not compiled, but execute instruction by instruction (which ends at the end of line or at a the next semi-colon).

Each of these interfaces are based on a *three windows* system in which one has a (i) editor, a (ii) object/variable explorer and a (iii) standard or iPython console. By using these three at the same time, on a large screen, writing, debugging and testing Python programs is very fast and practical. This is an example of how *Anaconda Spyder* looks like: \n",

    "\n",
    "The easiest way to learn Python and also to begin a new project is to use *iPython*, a project created by the programmer Fernando Perez in 2001 while he was a graduate student in particle physics at the University of Colorado Boulder. During his research Perez realized that the existing tools for scientific computing were insufficient and that Python was the perfect base to start to build new ones. Since then Perez has been involved in the development of the interactive version of Python, which nowadays became the Jupyter Notebook that you are reading and using. The goal of this giant effort is to create the simplest, most practical, flexible and easy to transport tool to prototyping and experimenting computational work. \n"

Python has always to choose one among them and the interpretation of your instruction will depend to this choice.

    "##### Extending Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides being dynamic, interpreted and interactive Python is also Object-Oriented (OO) and extensible. *Object Oriented Programming (OOP)* is a programming paradigm based on the idea that *objects*, and not *procedures* are at the center of a program, as in traditional programming. *OOP* is based on the idea of *Classes*, from which *Objects* are instantiated. The procedures are then defined only as *methods* associated to each Class and then inherited by objects, or by subclasses, which share some properties with the original Class, and possibly have new methods. The all concept of programming changes in *OOP* as in it objects interact with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "While initially *OPP* was mainly used for static programming, the most important of them is *C++*, in recent years many dynamic programming have been built based on the OOP concept, being *Python* the first of them. *OOP* plays a particular role in Python as it allows its exceptional *extensibility*, or in other words Python can be used to *Glue Together* a vast range of existing software, developed in a variety of languages, that otherwise could be forgotten, or not used, although they had been written with great care and in order to be very efficient. It was Guido van Rossum in person who pointed this out in 1998.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of *OOP* in numerical modeling, in particular geodynamic modeling, has been until present modest. This is mainly because our software is mainly based on solving complex and challenging mathematical formulations of geoscientific problems, which do not immediately require being written in *OOP*. However in the case of Python its *Modular* structure allows several important advantages. The first being the possibility to replace some inefficient Numerical Procedure in Standard Python with the better ones of Numerical Python (*NumPy*), but also to import fast libraries initially written in other languages. Let's see how this can be easily done.\n"

    "###### NumPy: Numerical Python\n",
    "\n",
    "For scientists Python represented the arrival of a programming language that finally integrates power and ease of use in a nearly optimal way. Its syntax is so simple to be comparable to a scripting language. Its enforced code structure makes it ideal for learning programming for scientists at learn their first language. However initially the main obstacle to a wide implementation was its lack of performance for large problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *game changing* innovation has been the arrival of numerical libraries that, if properly used, bring up its efficiency to the one of languages like C and Fortran. I will often use the words *C-speed*, in analogy to the speed of light, to mean that using specific libraries one can achieve computing efficiency comparable to the language *C*, that like *c* is the unsurpassable speed of physical objects, represents the optimal speed for standard programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the right mix of knowledge between how Python, and in particular its numerical library NumPy, uses the low level computer memory, it is possible to make Python performing like compiled codes, avoiding long implementations that are difficult to read and long and tedious debugging. Until now, most scientists have achieved a result comparable to that using Matlab, which is however a proprietary software, therefore with the limits imposed by the company and requiring a license. Python is an open source project and is freely available to everyone. While we write Python is scaling up globally and becoming the *de facto* programming language in science. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically in geophysics and geodynamics in particular, however, there is a lack of textbooks showing how Python can be used for specific applications. It is my intention to fill this gap with this book, searching for the right balance between introducing geophysicists to programming and teaching them to build geodynamics software.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at the features of *NumPy* in depth in a following Notebook. To show only a first example, we have seen above that in standard Python one can loop through different objects, and one can call functions with different *variable types*. While this in general is a powerful feature and has been designed to imitate human language, this is also what makes Python really slow. Every time the parser processes a new variable it has to *understand* what type it is and then use the right method. Also with very long lists the access of elements is slow due to the unknown size of every variable which makes its access consequential, i.e. O(n) where n is the size the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "These inefficiencies do not exist in standard compiled languages such as C and Fortran where instead of lists there are arrays of equal types, which allows both processing every variable and accessing every element at the speed of O(1). It also allows extremely efficient storage. *NumPy* offers these properties within a Python framework, leaving the remaining programming experience light and straightforward. \n"
